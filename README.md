Home Dashboard Project
======================

http://antrikshy.com/antrikshy-dashboard

This is a currently (and perhaps always) in progress home dashboard project.

Currently, it only displays the real-time temperature and humidity in my bedroom, powered by a DHT22 sensor and a Raspberry Pi Model B. Over time, I may add more features to it, to help me monitor other vitals and to control various smart gadgets that will inevitably find their way into my life.

I may or may not end up making this whole thing private at some point, as I connect more sensitive personal data in the future.
